        "Rivers are of great economic importance, from thermal power plants and nuclear power plants that need rivers to operate, public water supply to agriculture and transport. Although people today largely manage watercourses, weather conditions can lead to flooding, soil erosion and similar natural disasters. In order to be able to prepare for potential problems, it is necessary to investigate the behavior of the river based on multi-year monitoring of water levels. In this laboratory exercise, you will analyze the water levels of the Sava River over a period of 25 years.\n",
